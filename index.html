                <h2>About Tetris</h2>
                <p>This is my cat, Tetris. He is the sweetest, snuggliest li'l guy, and a total belly rub fiend. But he
                    wasn't always this way. My partner and I adopted him as a barn rescue when he was 3 years old, and
                    he was terrified by everything. For three months, we almost never saw him. Why, you ask? Because he
                    has a gift for contorting himself into weird shapes and squeezing into the snuggest spaces he can
                    find (<span id="secret">Hence his name</span>).</br></br>
                    He eventually decided to stop living life behind the washing machine and/or under the furnace, and
                    so far has not seemed to regret his change in lifestyle. His hobbies include not being picked up and
                    refusing to try new foods.</br></br>
                    Cat ipsum dolor sit amet, cough furball into food bowl then scratch owner for a new one lay on arms
                    while you're using the keyboard but then cats take over the world. Present belly, scratch hand when
                    stroked cat slap dog in face paw at your fat belly but purrrrrr, and and sometimes switches in
                    french and say "miaou" just because well why not is good you understand your place in my world or
                    sun bathe. Pee in human's bed until he cleans the litter box jump launch to pounce upon little yarn

                <h2>Life With Tetris</h2>
                <p>As far as our family and friends know, we don't even have a cat. Like me, he prefers quietly hiding
                    under furniture in the company of others. But those lucky enough to meet him know him to be a
                    tireless ball of energy with mad hops and a sick vert. If there's ever a Cat X-Games, he's got a
                    promising half-pipe career. His favorite games include jumping up high to catch his birdie, jumping
                    from high places to catch his birdie, and jumping into kitchen cabinets to remind me when I've left
                    them open. When he's not airborne, he enjoys snuggling on the couch watching videos of birds. (Have
                    I mentioned he likes birds?)</br></br>
                    Cat ipsum dolor sit amet, ask to be pet then attack owners hand and cat ass trophy. Eat fish on
                    floor climb into cupboard and lick the salt off rice cakes slap kitten brother with paw so sniff all
                    the things. Catasstrophe woops poop hanging from butt must get rid run run around house drag poop on
                    floor maybe it comes off woops left brown marks on floor human slave clean lick butt now climb leg,
                    so sugar, my siamese, stalks me (in a good way), day and night . Cuddle no cuddle cuddle love
                    scratch scratch attack like a vicious monster.

                <h2>In His Own Words</h2>
                <p>This is the part where I'd pretend to write in my cat's voice, but making a webpage biography for him
                    is dorky enough, so I'm not going to do that.</br></br>
                    Cat ipsum dolor sit amet, hide at bottom of staircase to trip human, mice hey! you there, with the
                    hands. Then cats take over the world. Friends are not food hey! you there, with the hands but poop
                    on floor and watch human clean up hiding behind the couch until lured out by a feathery toy find box
                    a little too small and curl up with fur hanging out or sit by the fire yet purr when give birth.
